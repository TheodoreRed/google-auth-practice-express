Google Developer Console Configuration:

1. Create a project in the Google Developer Console.
2. Set up OAuth consent by configuring the OAuth consent screen.
3. Create credentials (OAuth client ID and client secret).
4. Note down the client ID and client secret, as these will be used in your Express application.


Your code for implementing Google authentication in an Express.js application looks good for a basic setup. Here are a few things you might want to consider:

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is set correctly in your environment. This is used to specify the client ID of the app that accesses the backend.

2. **Error Handling**: You have a catch block to handle any errors that occur during the authentication process, which is great. You might want to log the error for debugging purposes.

3. **User Model**: Ensure that the `User` model in `../models/User` matches the `newUser` object structure.

4. **Database Connection**: The `getClient` function is used to get a database client. Make sure this function is implemented correctly and the database connection is properly set up.

5. **Token**: Ensure that the client sends the ID token in the body of the request.

6. **Client-side Setup**: On the client-side, you need to set up Google Sign-In. The client should send the ID token to your server.

Remember, this is a basic setup. Depending on your application's requirements, you might need to add more features, such as checking if the email is verified, handling user roles, etc. Always ensure to follow best practices for security.
